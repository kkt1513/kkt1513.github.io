    <h2>Research Topics</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Post-Quantum Cryptography</li>
        <p>    As quantum computing technology grows fast, need for safe crytographic system is increasing dramatically.</p>
      <li>Homomorphic Encryption</li>
        <p>    Homomorphic encryption is the most powerful tool for dealing with 4th generation security problems. 
          It enables theoretic secure computation through getting rid of the decryption key exchange step.</p>
      <li>GPU acceleration of homomorphic libraries</li>
        <p>    Full RNS HEAAN is homomorphic encryption library created by professor Cheon and his team.
      SEAL(Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library) was created by Microsoft. It offers BFV/CKKS scheme.</p>
